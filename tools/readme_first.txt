Because of some AV false positive, I couldn't load two compiled tools to the SF site:

bchunk.exe
bmpdump.exe

In the unlikely case you may need them, extract them from the password protected archive 
viral_tools.rar
password: dxwnd
or, if you prefer, build them by yourself (source and make included in their folders).
