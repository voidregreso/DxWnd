Beware!

The winmm.dll proxy triggers the suspicions of many AV software making it impossible to 
frrly distribute it. For this reasom the winmm.dll file was stored into the cyphered
winmm.rar file, passwrod protected with password "winmm".
This way the AV can't access its content and block the transfer.
Be aware that in case you may want to use that proxy the archive will have to be decompressed
on its current folder, but the operation could easily wake up the AV detection.
If that happens it is a false positive, but you don't have to believe me, so you may leave the
file alone as well.
