It should be noted that while for the first/only CD terminating the field value with a backslash or not is indifferent, for all following virtual disks that will be different since "c:\myCD\cd02" is not the same folder as "c:\myCD\cd\02".</p>

For instance, the pathname of the Windows system folder that is usually located in "C:\Windows" is translated to the Windows subfolder of the current folder. This prevents writing / reading files in the system folders and could be helpful to make portable applications with local configuration data. It should be noted that the flag may require early hooking to intercept operations before the first window creation. In addition, it is not always garanteed that all file accesses in system folders could be intercepted and redirected. All remapping folders will have to be created and be existing before the flag usage.</p>

This flag removes any CDROM devices that don't mount a CD from the list of available devices, so that you can simply unmount all disks except for the desired one.</p>
